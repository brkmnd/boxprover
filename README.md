# boxprover
This is a grammar and a parser, that targets JS for now, for https://boxprover.utr.dk/index.html
The goal is to make the application emit Latex markup to use with boxproof, though for now it can only create HTML markup for ditto.

Usage:
stack.js is needed by the parser. Thus in order to make this app work, copy the code of stack.js to somewhere reachable from the "parser" function.

ToDo:
Add usage discription, add latex as target...
