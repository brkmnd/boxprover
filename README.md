#boxprover
This is a grammar and a parser, that targets JS for now, for https://boxprover.utr.dk/index.html

Usage:
stack.js is needed by the parser. Thus in order to make this app work, copy the code of stack.js to somewhere reachable from the "parser" function.

The project itself is described in http://www.brkmnd.com/pages/projects/Default.aspx?id=27

The project has NO JS-dependencies, that is no npm,jQuery or whatever libraries are needed thus minimizing security risks when the app is not updated for long periods. I kind of doubt that this will be popular on app-stores or used by webpages with heavy traffic. Thus this app will not have high priority for my part. If you however find any errors, please note that in a comment on http://www.brkmnd.com/pages/projects/Default.aspx?id=29
